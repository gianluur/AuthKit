# AuthKit
In this repository i will store all my components, and i will configure authentication and authorization as i see fit for my purposes.
There isn't going to be anything super fancy, just what I would expect as an user to see in a site when i have to do any auth related stuff.
Please feel free to fork this repo to modify it as you see fit for yourself.

### Template
The first commit is just a simple boiler plate for a basic better-auth setup with shadcn installed and configured to install the ui elements inside components/shadcn-ui, you are going to find just a card, button, input, label and form.
